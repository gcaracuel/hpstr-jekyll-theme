This is my personal blog where a write about things I work with and other technologies I learn about. I am a tech lover. I started working as system administrator but I recently moved to a Devops (yes, the buzzword) position.

I'm insterented in a lot of technologies... If I have to write a full stack it maybe will contain:

* Linux, yes that my system
* Script programming languages: Python, Go, Bash...
* Web development: NodeJS, Python.
* NoSQL: MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
* Logs: Logstash, Fluentd...
* CI and CD: Jenkins, Bamboo, Gitlab, Maven....
* Data visualization: D3js, opendata...
* Streaming: Apache Mesos, Spark..
* Other great technologies: Packer, Vagrant, virtualization, web servers, load balancing... 

Love read and write about continious delivery, data visualization and NoSQL.

Oh! and I also loves bikes and cycling!
